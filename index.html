        <h2>Intro</h2>

        <p>
          It's hard to make your website accessible to everyone without
          first understanding all of the different ways people use computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/a11y-io/moving-buttons/html/index.html"
             target="_blank">
            Demo in the Inspire section of the Accessibility sandbox
          </a>
          can give you a better sense of how much of a difference
          making content accessible can be for users who really need
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Google, we encourage our web designers and web developers
          to experience using a screen reader, so they understand what
          it's like for a blind person to browse the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built this fake site, FriendPurr, to illustrate some of
          the ways that a website can be inaccessible, to give
          developers some experience catching and fixing common
          accessibility issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s get started!
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="friendpurr.html" target="_blank" id="open_popup">
            Click here to open Friendpurr in a new window
          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>
          Instructions
        </h2>

        <p>
          Make a note of issues you come across, or places where you
          feel like the usability could be improved as you take a look
          at keyboard focus, screen reader navigation, and contrast
          ratios.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Keyboard Focus
        </h3>

        <p>
          Use the Tab key on your keyboard to try to navigate content
          on the page. See if content is focusable, and if there is a
          logical tab order.
          </p>

        <p>
          It should always be possible to use any web app using only
          the keyboard. Some users can't easily use a mouse or other
          pointing device, and others just find it more efficient a
          lot of the time.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Use Tools to Run an Accessibility Audit
        </h3>

        <p>
          Run the
          <a href="https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/"
             target="_blank">
            Lighthouse DevTools accessibility audits
          </a>
          and take a look at the results.  Keep in mind that the
          audits don’t catch everything, so manually testing is
          usually needed to ensure an accessible experience.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Try using a screen reader
        </h3>

        <p>
          Turn on the screen reader:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            On a Chromebook, Turn on and off ChromeVox by pressing
            <b>Ctrl + Alt + Z</b>. Remember that you can press Ctrl to
            silence speech at any time. If you haven’t used
            ChromeVox, consider running through the tutorial by
            pressing Search + O, then T.
          </li>
          <li>
            On Mac, if you have a touch bar, you can triple-tap the power
            button on the touch bar - otherwise press Cmd+F5.

            Use Tab to navigate through the top links.  What do you notice?
          <li>
            Navigate to the images on the page.  Anything that needs
            to be updated?
          <li>
            Can you navigate everywhere you need to? Is your focus
            position clear?
          <li>
            Try to share with Marie.  What do you notice?
        </ul>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>
          We encourage you to try the steps above for yourself. Once
          you've done that, compare your notes to some of the issues we
          found below.
        </p>

        <h3>Low Contrast Text</h3>

        <div>
          <img src="low_contrast_text.png"
               alt="Top nav bar of the Friendpurr site, showing low contrast ratios of the text to background.">
        </div>

        <p>
          The text on the top nav bar can be hard to see for people
          with low vision. The ratio here is 4.2 and the guidelines
          are for text to be above a 4.5:1 ratio. The
          <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/#contrast"
             target="_blank">
            Chrome DevTools built-in checker
          </a>
          can help compute contrast ratios for you.
        </p>

        <h3>No Focus Highlights</h3>

        <p>
          When navigating by keyboard you can see a focus ring around
          the different elements. The “Circles” Nav button does not
          have this highlight. The text becomes bold, but that may be
          less perceivable to many. We want to ensure clear focus
          indication to avoid “focus roulette”.
        </p>

        <div>
          <img src="no_focus_highlights.png"
               alt="Top nav bar of the Friendpurr site, showing no focus rings around the Circles nav button when focused">
        </div>

        <h3>Unlabelled Button </h3>

        <p>
          The search button is unlabelled. When using a screen reader
          the user only hears that it is a “default button” thus not
          knowing what will happen if the button is selected.
        </p>

        <div>
          <img src="unlabelled_button.png"
               alt="Screenshot of the search button on the Friendpurr site">
        </div>

        <h3>Unlabelled Elements</h3>

        <p>
          The different friends that can be shared with are unlabelled
          checkboxes. The screen reader just reads checkbox, checked
          or unchecked leaving a screen reader user unable to know
          what it is they are selecting.
          <br>
          You also can’t use the keyboard to check or uncheck the checkboxes!
          <br>
          And there are unnecessary linear stops on the cat names that
          do not verbalize.
        </p>

        <div>
          <img src="unlabelled_elements.png"
               alt="Screenshot of the part of the Friendpurr site where you can share, where the controls are not labelled">
        </div>

        <h3>Unlabelled Images</h3>

        <div>
          <img src="unlabelled_images.png"
               alt="Screenshot of an unlabelled image on the Friendpurr site">
        </div>

        <p>
          The image has no alt-text. A screen reader is only told
          there is an image without getting any context to what the
          image is of.
        </p>

        <h3>Dialog Issues </h3>

        <div>
          <img src="dialog_issues.png"
               alt="Screenshot of the Complete Your Profile dialog in Friendpurr">
        </div>

        <p>
          When you press the Complete profile button, there are some
          issues. The window title is verbalized, which is great. But
          then you hear an uninformative update about progress. You
          can’t reliably get to the close or save changes button using
          the screen reader. Also, your focus can navigate outside of
          the dialog, which shouldn’t be possible with a modal dialog!
          Your focus should remain inside until you take action with a
          button or press Esc to close.

          Also, you can only get to the X close button through
          pressing Tab, and not through Search + Right or Left. And,
          the X button has a label of “times, button” instead of
          “close, button”.
        </p>
